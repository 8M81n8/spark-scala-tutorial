## Sacred Texts

The following ancient, sacred texts are from [www.sacred-texts.com/bib/osrc/](http://www.sacred-texts.com/bib/osrc/). All are copyright-free texts, where each verse is on a separate line, prefixed by the book name, chapter, number, and verse number, all "|" separated.

File | Description
:--- | :----------
`kjvdat.txt` | The King James Version of the Bible. For some reason, each line (one per verse) ends with a "~" character.
`t3utf.dat` | Tanach, the Hebrew Bible.
`vuldat.txt` | The Latin Vulgate.
`sept.txt` | The Septuagint (Koine Greek of the Hebrew Old Testament).
`ugntdat.txt` | The Greek New Testament.
`apodat.txt` | The Apocrypha (in English).
`abbrevs-to-names.tsv` | A map from the book abbreviations used in these texts to the full book names. Derived using data from the sacred-texts.com site.

There are many other texts from the world's religious traditions at the [www.sacred-texts.com](http://www.sacred-texts.com) site, but most of the others aren't formatted into one convenient file like these examples.
